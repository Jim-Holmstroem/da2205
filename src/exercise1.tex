\generateheader{Response 1}

    This is a response to the chapter on `The Scientific Process' in 
    Advice to a Young Scientist by Peter Medawar. It can be summarized as going
    trough and discussing the aspects of a scientific process, at different levels,
    such as; testing
    hypothesises by experimentation, using logic systems for deduction (with the
    possibility of asymmetry), as well as the self-correcting process of critical 
    evaluation.

    It seems by the text that machine learning in many ways tries to mimic the scientific
    process by, for example, setting up and testing hypothesis by
    experimentation and then refine these hypothesis according to the data and repeating
    this process
    until it reaches a good enough model of the data. One problem with this search
    for truth is the very
    vastness of the most general hypothesis space, where humans uses the "hunch" to
    guide the search but algorithms often fall short by lacking the possibility
    to use this concept, at least in the more general sense.

    The chapter also touches on the subject with trying to fit a hypothesis to seen
    data and not the other way around. This can be faulty especially when your
    data is sparse making it more plausible for a given hypothesis to
    be perceived as true solely by the effect of coincidence.
