    The chapter on Frege where about the conceptual milestones in the development of
    formal logic. Going from using the language with common sense to an algebra for 
    logic reasoning with a strict set of rules for deduction and reasoning. 
    
    The more abstract logical process from introducing strict concepts
    such as quantifiers($\exists,\forall$), truth functions, variables and
    predicates resulted not only in a less error-prone process but it makes 
    room for more advanced handling of logic since the actual logic problem do
    a pop-out.
    
    Also with the set of rules from the algebra it's easier, shorter and less
    error-prone to do inferences.
    These advantages resulted in the development of widely different
    scientific fields using this more formal logic instead of reasoning with
    sentences.
