    The chapter on Turing describes the process in which the concepts of
    algorithms and computations was formalized by the Turing machine. 
    Also a quite extensive description on how the Turing machine itself
    operates was included.

    The entire thing started out as a formalization of process in the hunt to show that
    entscheidungsproblem is unsolvable, but it turned out that this resulted in
    a formalization of both algorithms and computation. A formalization later to
    be used to concretize the general purpose computer as in those we see today.

    The Turing machine really breaks down the algorithm and computation to it's
    most basic building blocks and are still used in modern theoretical computer
    science.
