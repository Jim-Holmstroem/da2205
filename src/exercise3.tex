   The chapter on Turing describes the process in which the Turing machine was
   developed and why as well as a quite extensive description on how the Turing machine
   operates.

   The entire thing started out as a tool in the hunt to show that
   entschiel√∂ngsproblems can't generally be solved by a machine. but turned out that the
   concepts used was ideal to be used in computers. Handing a machine a
   "program" (was this a Turing discovery?) what has computability to do with
   this?
